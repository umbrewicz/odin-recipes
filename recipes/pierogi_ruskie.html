        <ol>
            <li>Pour the flour on a counter or other surface 
                that will allow you to make the dough;</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt;</li>
            <li>Make a little whole in a middle and start adding

            <li>Add a little water at the time and work the dough 
                until you can form a ball about 10-15 minutes;</li>
            <li>Once done, cover it with the big bowl and let it rest 
                for about 20-30 minutes;</li>
            <li>Roll the dough until thin (like pasta) and using either 
                cookie cutter or large wine glass cut the circles;</li>
            <li>Place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the middle of the circle;</li>

            <li>Boil large pot of water and season with salt;</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling put about 8 pierogi at the time;</li>
            <li>Once they come to the surface let them cook for 1 minute and 
                using a spider or slotted spoon take them out on a plate;</li>
            <li>If you want to fry them, use 1 tablespoon of oil or ghee 
                and fry pierogi on each side until golden brown;</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For the toppings:</h4>

            <li>Using separate pans add oil and onions and fry the onions 
                until golden brown and bacon until crispy (you don't need
